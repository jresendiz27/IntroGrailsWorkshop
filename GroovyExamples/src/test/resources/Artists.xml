        <bio>Barot has just finished his final year at The Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, where he excelled in
            glass etching paintings and portraiture. Hailed as one of the most diverse artists of his generation, Barot
            is equally as skilled with watercolors as he is with oils, and is just as well-balanced in different subject
            areas. Barot's collection entitled 'The Un-Collection' will adorn the walls of Gilbert Hall, depicting his
            range of skills and sensibilities - all of them, uniquely Barot, yet undeniably different

        <bio>The Art College in New Dehli has sponsored Hassum on scholarship for his entire undergraduate career at the
            university, seeing great promise in his contemporary paintings of landscapes - that use equal parts muted
            and vibrant tones, and are almost a contradiction in art. Hassum will be speaking on 'The use and absence of
            color in modern art' during Thursday's agenda.

        <bio>A native of New Orleans, much of Jennifer's work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding
            and rebuilding, having grown up as a teenager in the post-flood years. Despite the sadness of devastation
            and lives lost, Jennifer's work also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has persevered.
            Jennifer's exhibit will be discussed during Tuesday's Water in Art theme.

        <bio>LaVonne's giant-sized paintings all around Chicago tell the story of love, nature, and conservation -
            themes that are central to her heart. LaVonne will share her love and skill of graffiti art on Monday's
            schedule, as she starts the painting of a 20-foot high wall in the Rousseau Room of Hotel Contempo in front
            of a standing-room only audience in Art in Unexpected Places.

        <bio>Constance received the Fullerton-Brighton-Norwell Award for Modern Art for her mixed-media image of a tree
            of life, with jewel-adorned branches depicting the arms of humanity, and precious gemstone-decorated leaves
            representing the spouting buds of togetherness. The daughter of a New York jeweler, Constance has been
            salvaging the discarded remnants of her father's jewelry-making since she was five years old, and won the
            New York State Fair grand prize at the age of 8 years old for a gem-adorned painting of the Manhattan
            Bridge.

        <bio>A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design, Riley is already changing the face of
            modern art at the university. Riley's exquisite abstract pieces have no intention of ever being understood,
            but instead beg the viewer to dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind's eye. Riley will be
            speaking on the 'Art of Abstract' during Thursday's schedule

            sculptures, often the size of a rice granule, that are displayed by rear projection of microscope images on
            canvas. Xhou will discuss the art and science behind his incredibly detailed works of art.
